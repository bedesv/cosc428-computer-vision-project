# Steps to Run Rope Tracking
1. Ensure rope is hung in a room with ample area for flying the drone
2. Connect your computer to the Tello's WiFi network
3. Run drone_control.py
4. If you get an error about not being able to receive data from the Tello, you may need to disable your firewall temporarily, or just for the Tello's network
5. Fly the drone above the rope, using the arrow keys for directions, W and S for up and down, and A and D for rotation. Note that the drone must be parallel with the rope for the tracking to work
6. Press G to enable tracking. The drone will follow to the end of the rope then stop.
